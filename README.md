The default ports: Connection 11310, and RPC 11311
No premine. 

POW Details.

60 seconds block time POW.
Scrypt algorithm.
15 POW coins per block.
30 confirmations for mined blocks.
Difficulty retargets on every block.


POS Details.

POS activated on block 420,000 - Hard fork.

POSV stake once each month to earn highest possible rewards incentivises running full nodes to increase POS security. Coin age gradually slows after 1 month with an aging half life of 90 days.

Personal Investment Rate or PIR is a special reward algorithm unique for a PoS coin. The APR Stake reward increases in line with the value of the coins staked on a sliding scale.In other words the more Netcoin you own and stake the bigger the reward you earn. The last 3 years Netcoin had 3 different levels of PIR and it reached the last and final level end 2016.
The reward rates now are as followed: 0-999N --> 2%
                                      1000-9999N --> 4%
                                      10000-99999N --> 6%
                                      100000-999999N --> 7%
                                      1000000-9999999N --> 8%
                                      10000000N->>> --> 10%

120 seconds block time POS
1 hour minimum age for staking.  30 days max age.
FAIR-WEIGHT protocol replaces the idea of 'block splitting' to prevent very large NET holders signing lots of POS blocks.

70 confirmations for minted blocks
   	
Development process
===================

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when
they think their feature or bug fix is ready.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a
good thing.  Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches
if they don't match the project's coding conventions (see coding.txt)
or are controversial.

The master branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed
to be completely stable. Tags are regularly created to indicate new
official, stable release versions of Netcoin coin.

Feature branches are created when there are major new features being
worked on by several people.

From time to time a pull request will become outdated. If this occurs, and
the pull is no longer automatically mergeable; a comment on the pull will
be used to issue a warning of closure. The pull will be closed 15 days
after the warning if action is not taken by the author. Pull requests closed
in this manner will have their corresponding issue labeled 'stagnant'.

Issues with no commits will be given a similar warning, and closed after
15 days from their last activity. Issues closed in this manner will be 
labeled 'stale'.
